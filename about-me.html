                About:
            </h1>
            <p>Hello, my name is Wilson, a 1.71 meters man from Pacho, Cundinamarca, a green town near Bogotá. 
                At present, I have three things that occupy my day. 
                The first is my dog. It is a 5 years old English Cocker Spaniel. 
                We go for a walk in the morning and in the afternoon  but it’s not easy for the many “free” dogs out there. 
                Some kind, some four legs monsters. 
            </p>
                
            <p>The second is my work as a developer. 
                I build web pages and other stuff but everything relates to The Web. 
                It is a job that demands perpetual learning. At the end of the day, it’s a job that is more thinking than typing.
            </p> 
                
            <p>Finally, the third is this. I began to study Business and Commercial Management Technology last year. 
                This is my second semester in the university and I am very happy. 
                I see this as a new chance for me and I am working with my heart. I don't want to waste it. 
                It is not easy, but you know, _keep moving_.
            </p>
