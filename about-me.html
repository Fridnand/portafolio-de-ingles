                                  Hello, my name is Wilson, a 1.71 meters man from Pacho, Cundinamarca, a green town near Bogotá.
                              
                                  At present, I have three things that occupy my day.
                                
                               </p> 
                              
                               <p>
                                   The first is my dog. It is a 5 years old English Cocker Spaniel. 

                                   We go for a walk in the morning and in the afternoon  but it’s not easy for the many “free” dogs out there. 
                              
                                   Some kind, some four legs monsters.
                               </p> 
                              
                              
                                <p>
                                    The second is my work as a developer.

                                    I build web pages and other stuff but everything relates to The Web. 
                              
                                    It is a job that demands perpetual learning. 
                                    
                                    At the end of the day, it’s a job that is more thinking than typing.
                                
                                </p> 
                               
                                <p>
                                    Finally, the third is this.
                             
                                    I began to study Business and Commercial Management Technology last year. 
                              
                                    This is my second semester in the university and I am very happy. 
                              
                                    I see this as a new chance for me and I am working with my heart.
                              
                                    I don't want to waste it.
                              
                                    It is not easy, but you know, _keep moving_.
                                </p>
