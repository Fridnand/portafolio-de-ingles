    <h1>About me</h1>

    <p>Hello, my name is Wilson, a 1.71 meters man from Pacho, Cundinamarca, a green town near Bogotá. 
        At present, I have three things that occupy my day. 
        The first is my dog. It is a 5 years old English Cocker Spaniel. 
        We go for a walk in the morning and in the afternoon  but it’s not easy for the many “free” dogs out there. 
        Some kind, some four legs monsters. 
    </p>
        
    <p>The second is my work as a developer. 
        I build web pages and other stuff but everything relates to The Web. 
        It is a job that demands perpetual learning. At the end of the day, it’s a job that is more thinking than typing.
    </p> 
        
    <p>Finally, the third is this. I began to study Business and Commercial Management Technology last year. 
        This is my second semester in the university and I am very happy. 
        I see this as a new chance for me and I am working with my heart. I don't want to waste it. 
        It is not easy, but you know, _keep moving_.
    </p>
